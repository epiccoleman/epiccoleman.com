I have not been able to stop playing with ChatGPT today. My mind is completely blown by how good its results are and how easy it is to tune your results via further conversation with the bot.

I put this little project together in just under an hour of work. I generated almost the entire project with ChatGPT. All I had to do was add one dependency that ChatGPT did not put into the package.json.

ChatGPT was able to generate the basic structure of the main app component, and wrote all the update logic. It also helped generate React boilerplate code (for example, an `index.html` and `index.js`). I was really impressed by the ability the AI has to maintain context throughout a session - you could ask it to change logic around and it responds really intelligently.

If you have a rough idea of what it is that you're trying to do, it is incredibly easy to get ChatGPT to help you do it.

About 5 minutes of this project was spent setting up Github Pages.

You can play the game ChatGPT created [here](https://epiccoleman.github.io/chatgpt-incremental/).

You can read the code, and the conversation I had with ChatGPT to produce it, that produced this game [here](https://github.com/epiccoleman/chatgpt-incremental/blob/main/chatgpt-convo.md).

Once again I'm just blown away by what this thing is capable of.
