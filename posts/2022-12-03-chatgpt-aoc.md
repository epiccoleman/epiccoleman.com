So I was looking at [yesterday's Advent of Code problem](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2). And, coincidentally, yesterday I did a little chatting with [OpenAI's new ChatGPT AI](https://chat.openai.com/chat). I had it writing stories and song lyrics and telling jokes - it's a really neat piece of software. If you've seen any of the many memes and screenshots going around and haven't given it a shot yet, I think you should go check it out.

I've seen a couple examples of people asking it for coding advice, so I thought, what the hell, let's try it out on this Advent of Code problem. The results were pretty damn impressive.

So first observation is it came up with a clean, compact, and correct function that was actually better than where my mind was at (I had a whole if-else thing thought out, and then I was reminded that cond do was nicer/better for this case.)

But, it did need a read through, because the first iteration wasn't quite what I asked for - I wanted the result atom to reflect _player 2_'s win/loss. The initial version was implemented for player 1.

I know this thing's whole deal is that it can remember context, but i am super impressed that I can just ask for the next version in pretty plain english and it correctly figured out what i wanted and changed the code to match!

I copied this into my code and then started writing a quick little docstring for it. Then I thought, hey, why not let the bot do that too:

Now this is almost more impressive to me - the description of the function is a little terse and I would probably add a sentence about the parameters. But it's also totally acceptable.

Then it goes the extra mile: it wrote a typespec for me (I don't usually bother with those, but hey, it's free).

Also, it wrote a bunch of unit tests - because those examples prefixed with `iex>` in the docstring are what are called [doctests](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/docs-tests-and-with.html). With just a single line of extra code in your test file, these examples in the documentation can be set up to run as part of the test suite. (Elixir is cool!)

OK, so on that train of thought, I asked it to write a unit test for me:

>**Eric Coleman**

OK, so that's pretty good. The two tests correctly describe the behavior.

Also, they reveal a behavior that I hadn't thought of when I read through the initial function - that you can pass any string into the function, and it will just return a draw. So, I need to think about that and if it's what I want, or if I should add some guards or something and throw when the args aren't one of "rock", "paper", or "scissors". (Probably fine for this case, since it's just Advent of Code, but if it was code I was being paid for, that's a pretty valuable hint that the initial implementation needs some extra attention.)

However, it seemed to miss a bit of the intent of the test it wrote. It named the test "player 2 wins" but then also described cases where player 2 lost. The code's still correct, but the name needs to be fixed. Here's where it gets a bit confused:

So, it correctly added a new test with the right name, but it kept the same implementation. I mean at this point, I could copy and paste and just delete the junk lines, and boom, instant tests. But let's see if GPT can figure out what I want:

Ahh, so we've lost the plot a bit here. First off, it didn't really do what I asked for. And more importantly, the test no longer passes. And what's worse - it tells you that it would pass! I guess to be completely fair, it does say "this is an example", so it makes no claim that it ran the test in the background. But still, it certainly looks like it's telling you that the pass _would_ pass.

At this point the pragmatic thing to do would probably be to just copy / pastes the test to my test file and delete the wrong lines, but let's see if we can get it back on track:

Well, it's a _little_ closer, in that the `player 2 loses` test now only has three assertions. But they're the wrong assertions, and so the test won't pass. Again, at this point it would make sense to just throw in the towel. But let's be very specific about what we want and see if ChatGPT can get it right:

> The "player 2 loses" test is still wrong. It should only include the following cases: ("rock", "scissors"), ("paper", "rock"), and ("scissors", "paper"). Can you rewrite it so that those are the only cases in that test? We expect the :lose atom to be returned for each of these cases.

So I had to specify the cases to the point that it would have been faster to just write the code, but still, with gentle direction, it produced what I asked for. It's sort of like a junior programmer who is ridiculously good at remembering syntax, I guess - a valuable pair partner but you wouldn't trust them to go off on their own just yet.

Just for fun, let's get it to fix that first test:

So close, but there's still an issue. That's ok though, my robotic friend - let me help:

So, that's my little demo. I am honestly blown away by this thing. The conversational nature of interacting with it is really cool and natural too. I leaned toward overspecificity a lot in this conversation, but there are a few places where I was somewhat ambiguous and it figured out what I meant.

I don't know what to think about how this will change programming, but I can't help but feel that we're on the precipice of a bit of a paradigm shift when computer assistance is this good.

Overall I'm quite impressed and definitely plan to utilize this for future coding.
