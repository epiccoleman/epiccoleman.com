My mind is completely blown by how good its results are and how easy it is to tune your results via further conversation with the bot.</p><p>I put this little project together in just under an hour of work. I generated almost the entire project with ChatGPT. All I had to do was add one dependency that ChatGPT did not put into the package.json.</p><p>ChatGPT was able to generate the basic structure of the main app component, and wrote all the update logic. It also helped generate React boilerplate code (for example, an <code class="inline">index.html</code> and <code class="inline">index.js</code>). I was really impressed by the ability the AI has to maintain context throughout a session - you could ask it to change logic around and it responds really intelligently.</p><p>If you have a rough idea of what it is that you’re trying to do, it is incredibly easy to get ChatGPT to help you do it.</p><p>About 5 minutes of this project was spent setting up Github Pages.</p><p>You can play the game ChatGPT created <a href="https://epiccoleman.github.io/chatgpt-incremental/">here</a>.</p><p>You can read the code, and the conversation I had with ChatGPT to produce it, that produced this game <a href="https://github.com/epiccoleman/chatgpt-incremental/blob/main/chatgpt-convo.md">here</a>.</p><p>Once again I’m just blown away by what this thing is capable of.</p>
